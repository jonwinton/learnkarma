It can probably be ignored. Seriously. But if you're not going to igore it...

1. Download the repo
2. (In terminal) Run `npm install`
3. Run `grunt`

- Master branch has a folder inside `src` called `lesson-1`. It's a super, super basic module that passes tests.
- Branch `feature/lesson-2` has a namespaced constructor that instantiates another constructor that passes tests.
- Branch `feature/lesson-3` is under dev and should be a functioning RequireJS implementation

## Development is in process on `lesson-3`
