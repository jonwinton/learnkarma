# This is a repo where I'm teaching myself TDD

It can probably be ignored. Seriously. But if you're not going to igore it...

1. Download the repo
2. (In terminal) Run `npm install`
3. Run `grunt`

- Master branch has a folder inside `src` called `lesson-1`. It's a super, super basic module that passes tests.
- Branch `feature/lesson-2` has a namespaced constructor that instantiates another constructor that passes tests.
- Branch `feature/lesson-3` is a basic RequireJS setup for testing modules. Read the commit messages for lessons learned in making it.
- Branch `feature/lesson-4` is under dev and will **ideally** be a setup with Babel and RequireJS.
- Branch `feature/lesson-5` is slated to be more of an exploration into testing against multiple browsers.
- Branch `feature/lesson-6` is TBD
